# Data analysis with Python
This repository contains four mini-projects files on Data analysis with Python.\
All projects are done in _Jupyter notebook_.

## Biodiversity
It's a project on analyzing some data about species at various national parks. The data for this project is inspired by real data, but mostly fictional.\
Python libraries used: _Pandas, Matplotlib_. 

## Chocolate Scraping
In this project, I used Beautiful Soup to get data about over 1700 reviews of chocolate bars from all around the world. Then, I used Pandas and Matplotlib to answer the questions:
* Where are the best cocoa beans grown? 
* Which countries produce the highest-rated bars? 
* Whatâ€™s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?\
Python libraries used: _Pandas, Matplotlib, Beautiful Soup_.

## MuscleHub
In this project, I use MuscleHub data (a fancy gym) to run an A/B test.\
Python libraries used: _Pandas, Matplotlib_.

## US Census
This project is about analyzing census data provided by the Census Bureau with Pandas, and using results to visualize some insights on gender and race.\
Python libraries used: _Pandas, Matplotlib_.
